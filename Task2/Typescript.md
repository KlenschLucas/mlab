# Typescript

## Introduction

Typescript is an open source programming langauge developed by Microsoft. Typescript is a superset of Javascript. When writing typescript before being able to run it, it will first need to be transpiled to javascript and the resulting javascript will be run.

TS adds static typing to JS, which makes use of dynamic typing. Dynamic typed languages are usually slower in performance and more error prone as types add safeguards against the most common errors made by developers.

Example of Typescript code

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  const c = a + b;
  return c;
}
```

## Conclusion

Typescript is an amazing tool, allowing developers to write better code, cleaner code and more maintainable code.
