## HTML

HyperText Markup Language is the markup language used to create web pages, it is one of the only languages able to be interpreted natively by the browser along with CSS and Javascript. HTML started off as an easy way to create documents but soon it's potential was seen and now it supported by the web. Currently we have HTML5 the latest version of HTML after the failure of HTML4. HTML follows an xml schema such as:

```html
<tagname>content</tagname>
```

## CSS

Cascading StyleSheet is the language that describes the style of an HTML document ie. how HTML elements should be displayed/look. We currently are on CSS3. CSS can be embedded inside the html page with `<style></style>` tags or referenced from another file. CSS uses a key-value like system, as follows:

```CSS
body {
  color: green;
}
```

## Git

`Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.`

Git allows each member of a project to own a version of the project that they can edit and publish changes on, ie committing which allows changes to be tracked. When a member wants to share the changes they would push the code to a server such as github/gitlab or a self hosted git server. Each member would be able to do a pull of the code and thus be receiving the updated code.
